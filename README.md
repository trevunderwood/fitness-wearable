# fitness-wearable

This repository contains the code required to run the webapp and Arduino for the fitness wearable.

## Webapp Files
The top-level directory contains several files that Django requires.

## Arduino Files
The most important files for the Arduino are Fitness_Tracker.ino and ei-fitnesstracker-arduino-1.0.8.zip.  
ei_fitnesstracker-arduino-1.0.8.zip must be included as a library.  
Fitness_Tracker.ino is the primary Arduino code for the project.
